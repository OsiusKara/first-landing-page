This is my code for first NON-responsive Landing Page project in The Odin Project Foundations course.

## Project Details

The Odin Project provided a [webpage design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png "webpage design") that I needed to clone using HTML and CSS for the desktop. They also provided a [style guide ](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png "style guide ")for colors and font sizes. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and getting various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

## Skills Learned

- Becoming more comfortable with CSS Flexbox, especially justify- content and align-item rules
- Getting more grasp of relative units (em,rem,%â€¦)
- Researching and finding project related assets like Icons, colors, gradients typefaces and different generators, such as box-shadows
- Continuing to practice Git and Github project management
- Taking someone else's design and using HTML/CSS to make it happen
- Working on a project over multiple days and focusing on certain sections only
